So, compared to the other options like Python, you can get up and running in R doing data science, learning much, much less about programming to get started. And that generally makes it like easier to get up and running if you don’t have formal training in computer science or software engineering.\n\n\n-Hadley Wickham, Advice to Young (and Old) Programmers: A Conversation with Hadley Wickham"

See the syllabus for guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments.

    "text": "Getting setup with Git and GitHub\nIf you are not working on the maize RStudio server, then make sure that you have installed all of the software mentioned in Computing Access. In addition, you should install the usethis and gitcreds R packages.\nEveryone needs to connect Git and GitHub by doing the following:\n\nRegister for account on GitHub (https://github.com/). I recommend using a username that incorporates your name (e.g. aloy). Please use your Carleton email with this account.\n\nSetup options in Git by running the following code chunk in your console:\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\", user.email = \"jane@example.org\")\nchanging the first two lines to your own name and email (this should be the email associated with your GitHub account).\n\n\n(Optional) This step explains how to use GitHub on RStudio without having to enter your password every time to connect. This is an optional step since you can still use GitHub without setting up a SSH key or caching credentials, you will just need to enter your password every time you push or pull with GitHub. Pick one method below: cache credentials for HTTPS or SSH. GitHub recommends HTTPS, so I recommend trying that first.\n\n\nStrongly recommended: Cache credential using a HTTPS linked project.\nComplete the steps in Section 10.1 of Happy Git with R to get a personal access token (you will need to install the usethis package first). Then, follow the directions in Section 10.2.1 of Happy Git with R (I’ve had good luck with the gitcreds package, and it is installed on maize.)\n\nA second method is to generate a SSH key. First check to see if you have a SSH key. Go into the shell (again, through RStudio Tools -&gt; Shell) and complete on this page http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html, which is Chapter 11 in Happy Git with R.\n\n\n(optional) Follow the instructions here (http://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) to ensure you can connect to GitHub from your computer. If you can’t get this command line push/pull to work that is fine. Try connecting to GitHub via RStudio, as detailed next. If you can’t connect via RStudio then contact me.",

    "section": "Individual assignments",
    "text": "Individual assignments\nIf you followed the suggestions in the Using Rstudio in Stat 220 page, then you should already have an assignments folder on your computer or maize account.\nEach new assignment/project will be posted as a repository on GitHub and added directly to your account (within the Stat220 organization). This repository will contain assignment details (README, .Rmd).\nCreating an individual assignment repo and project\n\nGo to our course GitHub organization page and find your homework repo, such as hw-1-username (where your username is attached).\nEnter the online assignment repository on GitHub. Click the green “Code” button. Most of you should just use the default setting which is to “clone” (copy) using HTTPS. Click the clipboard to the right of the URL to copy the repo location. (If you are using SSH, make sure it says “Clone with SSH” in bold in the top left of the pop-up box. If not, click the “SSH” button and copy the link in the box to your clipboard.)\nNow open up RStudio and create a project as follows:\n\n\nClick the Project button in the upper right corner of your RStudio window and select New Project….\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Version Control and then New Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaste the link you just copied into the Repository URL box. Leave the Project directory name blank (or keep the auto-filled name). Use the Browse button to find your assignments folder, then click Create Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \nWarning: If you received an error in the above steps, you may have to clone with HTTPS instead of SSH (or vice versa). You can do this by again clicking on the “Clone or Download” button in the repository page, then clicking “Use HTTPS” in the top right of the pop-up box. Now copy the link and repeat this step.\nWorking on your assignment\nAn RStudio project should now open, which will allow you to start working on your homework assignment. You should see the project assignment name in the top right side of Rstudio. You will probably see a blank console screen when you open a new project. Look in the Files tab for your homework .Rmd file. Click on whatever file you want to edit (probably the .Rmd file) and edit away. Make sure that your current assignment’s project is the one open and showing in the upper rightproject name. To open a project, click on the .Rproj file or use the Open Project… option available in the upper right project link.\nCommits\nAfter you make changes to the homework assignment, commit them. What are commits you ask? Commits are essentially taking a snapshot of your projects. Commits save this snapshot to your local version of Git (located on your hard drive or the maize server). For example, if I make changes to a code so that it prints “Hello world”, and then commit them with an informative message, I can look at the history of my commits and view the code that I wrote at that time. If I made some more changes to the function that resulted in an error, I could go back to the commit where the code was originally working. This prevents you from creating several versions of your homework (homework-v1, homework-v2, …) or from trying to remember what your code originally looked like.\nYou can make commits in the Git tab in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Commit button in the Git tab. Check the boxes of the files that you want to commit, enter your commit message (briefly state what changes have been made), then hit Commit. You can read how to do this in RStudio in more detail here: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-commit.\nTwo things about committing.\n\nYou should commit somewhat frequently. At minimum, if you’re doing a homework assignment, you should make a commit each time that you’ve finished a question.\nLeave informative commit messages. “Added stuff” will not help you if you’re looking at your commit history in a year. A message like “Added initial version of hello-world function” will be more useful.\nPushing changes to Github\nAt some point you’ll want to get the updated version of the assignment back onto GitHub, either so that we can help you with your code or so that it can be graded. You will also want to push work frequently when you have a shared GitHub repo for project collaborations (i.e. more than one person is working on a project and code). If you are ready to push, you can again click on the “Up” Push arrow in the Git tab or in the Commit pop-up window or in the Git tab (shown above).\nTo “turn in” an assignment, all you need to do is push all your relevant files to Github by the deadline.",

Clone this repo to your computer/maize account using the same steps done for an individual assignment (see steps 2-3).\nWorking with collaborative repos\nFor group homework, I suggest that only the recorder edit the group-homework-x.Rmd file to avoid merge conflicts! Other group members can create a new Markdown doc to run and save commands. Only the recorder needs to push changes (answers) to the Github repo and all others can then pull these changes (i.e. the final answers) after the HW is submitted.\nWhen you are working together on a Github project, you should commit and push your modifications frequently. You will also need to frequently pull updates from Github down to your local version of RStudio. These updates are changes that your teammates have made since your last pull. To pull in changes, click the “Down” Pull arrow in the Git tab (shown above).\nIf you get an error about conflict after pulling or pushing, don’t freak out! This can happen if you edit a file (usually an .Rmd or .R file) in a location that was also changed by a teammate. When this happens you should attempt to fix the merge conflict. Take a look at this resource site and try to fix the merge conflict in Rstudio. If that doesn’t work contact me!",

Each course grade requires consistent quality across all bins to earn the grade\nYou do not have to do everything. If you want an “A” in the class, for example, you don’t have to complete every quiz question correctly, only 90% of them."

Milestone check-ins cannot be revised\nYou may use a token for an extension on the lab quiz resubmission, but not on the in-class portion. You do not need to use a token to resubmit each lab quiz.\nYou can revise the same portfolio project multiple times, if needed, but you must spend a token each time.\nA portfolio project must be completed with a good-faith effort to be eligible for revision. If I deem a submission to be “not assessable” due to a lack of effort, then it cannot be revised.\nAll revisions must be submitted by 11:59pm on the last day of class."

You have two options for using RStudio:\n\nThe server version of RStudio on the web at https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu. The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer on campus using a web browser. The downside is that you have to share limited computational resources with each other!\nA local version of RStudio installed on your machine.The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, but I get around this problem by keeping all of my work on GitHub. You will learn how to use GitHub throughout the course.\n\nNote that you do not have to choose one or the other, you may use both. However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source."
