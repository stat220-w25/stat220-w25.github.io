    "section": "Extracting pieces of data frames",
    "text": "Extracting pieces of data frames\nSince data frames are the fundamental data structure for most analyses in R, it’s important to know how to work with them. You already know how to get an overview of a data frame, but that isn’t always very informative. Often, you want to extract pieces of a data frame, such as a specific column or row.\nExtracting rows\nData frames can be indexed by their row/column numbers. To extract elements of a data frame, the basic syntax is data_set[row.index, column.index]. So, to extract the 10th row of office_ratings we run\n\noffice_ratings[10, ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  season episode title    imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      2       4 The Fire         8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n\n\nNotice that to extract an entire row, we leave the column index position blank.\nWe can also extract multiple rows by creating a vector of row indices. For example, we can extract the first 5 rows via\n\noffice_ratings[1:5, ]\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  season episode title         imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                 7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      1       2 Diversity Day         8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n3      1       3 Health Care           7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n4      1       4 The Alliance          8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n5      1       5 Basketball            8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n\n\nHere, 1:5 create a sequence of integers from 1 to 5.\nWe could also specify arbitrary row index values by combing the values into a vector. For example, we could extract the 1st, 13th, 64th, and 128th rows via\n\noffice_ratings[c(1, 13, 64, 128), ]\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 6\n  season episode title            imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                    7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      2       7 The Client               8.6        2631 2005-11-08\n3      4      13 Job Fair                 7.9        1977 2008-05-08\n4      7      11 Classy Christmas         8.9        2138 2010-12-09\n\n\nExtracting columns\nSimilar to extracting rows, we can use a numeric index to extract the columns of a data frame. For example, to extract the 3rd column, we can run\n\noffice_ratings[,3]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nAlternatively, we can pass in the column name in quotes instead of the column number\n\noffice_ratings[,\"title\"]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nNotice that the extracted column is still formatted as a data frame (or tibble). If you want to extract the contents of the column and just have a vector of titles, you have a few options.\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column number:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[3]]\n\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column name in quotes:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[\"title\"]]\n\n\nYou could use the $ extractor with the column name (not in quotes):\n\n\noffice_ratings$title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract the 35th row of office_ratings.\nExtract rows 35, 36, 37, and 38 of office_ratings.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column index number.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column name."

For example, to extract the stat_faculty you could run\n\nmast[[1]]\n\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n\nor\n\nmast[[\"stat_faculty\"]]\n\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you had only used a single bracket above, the returned object would still be a list, which is typically not what we would want.\n\nmast[1]\n\n$stat_faculty\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\nExtract the statistics courses offered this term."

    "section": "Vectors",
    "text": "Vectors\nThe columns of the office_ratings data frame and the elements of the mast list were comprised of (atomic) vectors. Unlike lists, all elements within a vector share the same type. For example, all names in the stat_faculty vector were character strings and all ratings in the imdb_rating column were numeric. We’ll deal with a variety of types of vectors in this course, including:\n\nnumeric\ncharacter (text)\nlogical (TRUE/FALSE)\n\nExtracting elements of a vector\nJust like with lists (and therefore data frames), we use brackets to extract elements from a vector. As an example, let’s work with the title column from office_ratings.\n\ntitle &lt;- office_ratings$title # vector of titles\n\nTo extract the 111th title, we run\n\ntitle[111]\n\n[1] \"New Leads\"\n\n\nor two extract the 100th through 111th titles, we run\n\ntitle[100:111]\n\n [1] \"Double Date\"          \"Murder\"               \"Shareholder Meeting\" \n [4] \"Scott's Tots\"         \"Secret Santa\"         \"The Banker\"          \n [7] \"Sabre\"                \"Manager and Salesman\" \"The Delivery: Part 1\"\n[10] \"The Delivery: Part 2\" \"St. Patrick's Day\"    \"New Leads\"           \n\n\nNegative indices\nSometimes, we want to “kick out” elements of our vector. To do this, we can use a negative index value. For example,\n\ntitle[-1]\n\nreturns all but the first title—that is, it kicks out the first title. To kick out multiple elements, we need to negate a vector of indices. For example, below we kick out the first 10 titles\n\ntitle[-c(1:10)]\n\nAnd now we kick out the 5th, 50th, and 150th titles\n\ntitle[-c(5, 50, 150)]\n\nThis idea can be adapted to lists and data frames. For example, to kick out the first row of office_ratings, we run\n\noffice_ratings[-1,]\n\n# A tibble: 187 × 6\n   season episode title             imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n 1      1       2 Diversity Day             8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n 2      1       3 Health Care               7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n 3      1       4 The Alliance              8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n 4      1       5 Basketball                8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n 5      1       6 Hot Girl                  7.8        2852 2005-04-26\n 6      2       1 The Dundies               8.7        3213 2005-09-20\n 7      2       2 Sexual Harassment         8.2        2736 2005-09-27\n 8      2       3 Office Olympics           8.4        2742 2005-10-04\n 9      2       4 The Fire                  8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n10      2       5 Halloween                 8.2        2561 2005-10-18\n# ℹ 177 more rows\n\n\nor to kick out the math courses from the mast list we run\n\nmast[-4]\n\n$stat_faculty\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n$stat_courses\n[1] 120 220 230 250 285 330\n\n$math_faculty\n [1] \"Brooke\"              \"Davis\"               \"Egge\"               \n [4] \"Gomez-Gonzales\"      \"Haunsperger\"         \"Johnson\"            \n [7] \"Meyer\"               \"Montee\"              \"Shrestha\"           \n[10] \"Terry\"               \"Thompson\"            \"Turnage-Butterbaugh\"\n\n\nLogical indices\nIt’s great to be able to extract (or omit) elements using indices, but sometimes we don’t know what index value we should use. For example, if you wanted to extract all of the 300-level statistics courses from the stat_courses vector, you would need to manually determine that positions 2:5 meet that requirement. That’s a lot of work! A better alternative is to allow R to find the elements meeting that requirement using logical operators. Below is a table summarizing common logical operators in R.\n\n\nComparison\nMeaning\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nis equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n\nIn order to extract the 300-level statistics courses, we’ll take two steps:\n\nWe’ll determine whether each course is numbered at least 300,\nthen we’ll use that sequence of TRUEs/FALSEs to extract the course.\n\nSo, first we use the logical operator &gt;= to compare stat_courses and 300. This returns TRUE if the element meets the specification and FALSE otherwise.\n\nstat_courses &gt;= 300\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nNow, we can use this vector as our index. Only the TRUE elements will be extracted:\n\nstat_courses[stat_courses &gt;= 300]\n\n[1] 330\n\n\nThe same idea can be used with data frames and lists, just remember how to format the brackets and indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract all statistics courses below 250 from stat_courses.\nExtract all math courses except for 240 (probability) from math_courses.\nExtract all rows from season 3 of The Office.\n\n\n\ns"

In addition, you should install the usethis and gitcreds R packages.\nEveryone needs to connect Git and GitHub by doing the following:\n\nRegister for account on GitHub (https://github.com/). I recommend using a username that incorporates your name (e.g. aluby). Please use your Carleton email with this account (you can connect multiple emails to a single GitHub account)\n\nSetup options in Git by running the following code chunk in your console:\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\", user.email = \"jane@example.org\")\nchanging the first two lines to your own name and email (this should be the email associated with your GitHub account).\n\n\nIn order to commit and push to GitHub via R, you need to create a PAT (Personal Access Token). This is like a Password 2.0. When RStudio prompts you for your GitHub username and password, use your PAT instead.\n\nComplete the steps in Happy Git with R Ch 9.3 to get a personal access token. I recommend using the “classic” token, but either should work. You will need workflow, user, and repo scopes (permissions) for this class, and I recommend setting it for 90 days so you won’t need a new one through the end of the term. Make sure to save this somewhere safe!\n\n\nIt will be annoying to type your PAT in anytime you want to push to github. Instead, tell R to store your git credentials with gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). When prompted for your password, use your PAT from Step 3.\n\n&gt; gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\n? Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n-&gt; Adding new credentials...\n-&gt; Removing credentials from cache...\n-&gt; Done.\nTo see if things are set up correctly, run\nusethis::git_sitrep()",

    "section": "Individual assignments",
    "text": "Individual assignments\nIf you followed the suggestions in the Using Rstudio in Stat 220 page, then you should already have an assignments folder on your computer or maize account.\nEach new assignment/project will be posted as a repository on GitHub and added directly to your account (within the Stat220 organization). This repository will contain assignment details (README, .Rmd).\nCreating an individual assignment repo and project\n\nGo to our course GitHub organization page and find your homework repo, such as hw-1-username (where your username is attached).\nEnter the online assignment repository on GitHub. Click the green “Code” button. Most of you should just use the default setting which is to “clone” (copy) using HTTPS. Click the clipboard to the right of the URL to copy the repo location. (If you are using SSH, make sure it says “Clone with SSH” in bold in the top left of the pop-up box. If not, click the “SSH” button and copy the link in the box to your clipboard.)\nNow open up RStudio and create a project as follows:\n\n\nClick the Project button in the upper right corner of your RStudio window and select New Project….\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Version Control and then New Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaste the link you just copied into the Repository URL box. Leave the Project directory name blank (or keep the auto-filled name). Use the Browse button to find your assignments folder, then click Create Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \nWarning: If you received an error in the above steps, you may have to clone with HTTPS instead of SSH (or vice versa). You can do this by again clicking on the “Clone or Download” button in the repository page, then clicking “Use HTTPS” in the top right of the pop-up box. Now copy the link and repeat this step.\nWorking on your assignment\nAn RStudio project should now open, which will allow you to start working on your homework assignment. You should see the project assignment name in the top right side of Rstudio. You will probably see a blank console screen when you open a new project. Look in the Files tab for your homework .Rmd file. Click on whatever file you want to edit (probably the .Rmd file) and edit away. Make sure that your current assignment’s project is the one open and showing in the upper rightproject name. To open a project, click on the .Rproj file or use the Open Project… option available in the upper right project link.\nCommits\nAfter you make changes to the homework assignment, commit them. What are commits you ask? Commits are essentially taking a snapshot of your projects. Commits save this snapshot to your local version of Git (located on your hard drive or the maize server). For example, if I make changes to a code so that it prints “Hello world”, and then commit them with an informative message, I can look at the history of my commits and view the code that I wrote at that time. If I made some more changes to the function that resulted in an error, I could go back to the commit where the code was originally working. This prevents you from creating several versions of your homework (homework-v1, homework-v2, …) or from trying to remember what your code originally looked like.\nYou can make commits in the Git tab in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Commit button in the Git tab. Check the boxes of the files that you want to commit, enter your commit message (briefly state what changes have been made), then hit Commit. You can read how to do this in RStudio in more detail here: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-commit.\nTwo things about committing.\n\nYou should commit somewhat frequently. At minimum, if you’re doing a homework assignment, you should make a commit each time that you’ve finished a question.\nLeave informative commit messages. “Added stuff” will not help you if you’re looking at your commit history in a year. A message like “Added initial version of hello-world function” will be more useful.\nPushing changes to Github\nAt some point you’ll want to get the updated version of the assignment back onto GitHub, either so that we can help you with your code or so that it can be graded. You will also want to push work frequently when you have a shared GitHub repo for project collaborations (i.e. more than one person is working on a project and code). If you are ready to push, you can again click on the “Up” Push arrow in the Git tab or in the Commit pop-up window or in the Git tab (shown above).\nTo “turn in” an assignment, all you need to do is push all your relevant files to Github by the deadline.",

Clone this repo to your computer/maize account using the same steps done for an individual assignment (see steps 2-3).\nWorking with collaborative repos\nFor group homework, I suggest that only the recorder edit the group-homework-x.Rmd file to avoid merge conflicts! Other group members can create a new Markdown doc to run and save commands. Only the recorder needs to push changes (answers) to the Github repo and all others can then pull these changes (i.e. the final answers) after the HW is submitted.\nWhen you are working together on a Github project, you should commit and push your modifications frequently. You will also need to frequently pull updates from Github down to your local version of RStudio. These updates are changes that your teammates have made since your last pull. To pull in changes, click the “Down” Pull arrow in the Git tab (shown above).\nIf you get an error about conflict after pulling or pushing, don’t freak out! This can happen if you edit a file (usually an .Rmd or .R file) in a location that was also changed by a teammate. When this happens you should attempt to fix the merge conflict. Take a look at this resource site and try to fix the merge conflict in Rstudio. If that doesn’t work contact me!",

This project consists of three parts:\n\nReplicating an existing graph using ggplot2. Depending on the graph you choose, this may require some creativity in recreating data.\nUsing design principles from class, re-design the original graph to be better. This should include, at minimum, changes to two of the “layers” of the grammar of graphics (data, aesthetics, geometries, facets, statistics, coordinates, and theme).\nA written summary (no more than 1 printed page) including (1) an evaluation of the original graph and (2) reasoning for your design choices in improving the graph. This should include references to readings and discussions from class.\n\n\n\nOptions and Examples\nThe list below includes some good places to get started finding a graph. You do not have to choose a graph from one of these sources. It can be hard to find associated data with some published graphs, so don’t spend too much time trying to find data for a specific graph before moving on.\n\nOur World In Data\nFiveThirtyEight + Associated R Package (See available data here).\nHelpMeViz\nDataIsPlural\nTidyTuesday – If you choose this option, please be especially kind in your critique. This is a weekly R community activity, and many submissions are by beginners.\nr/dataisbeautiful\nr/dataisugly\n\n\n\nSubmission\nYour submission should include two visualizations (replication and improvement), a written overview of your work, and all associated code. You should work in a rmarkdown or quarto file. Your knitted/rendered file can be either pdf or html. I will distribute GitHub skeleton repos that you should fill in as you work. You should commit your final code and output file to your repo and link your repo to gradescope to submit.\n\n\nRubric\nA successful project will:\n\nInclude all necessary components pushed to GitHub and linked to gradescope\nContain code, plots, and written summary in a single .rmd document\nThe .rmd with all necessary code for recreation\nThe .rmd does not include unnecessary code\nProvide a thoughtful summary and critique\nThe replication matches the original graph on all layers of the grammar of graphics (data, aesthetics, geometries, facets, statistics, coordinates, and theme)\nThe improved graph has made changes to at least two of the layers\n\nAesthetics faithfully represent the representation of the underlying data\n\nMeet minimum submission quality standards\n\nVery few grammatical mistakes, spelling mistakes, or typos\nAppropriate labels and font sizes\nA readable theme\nThe rendered document does not contain any unnecessary content (package loading messages, warnings, etc.)\n\n\nAn excellent project will meet all of the requirements for a successful project, plus\n\nBe published (publicly!) to the web. (It is a portfolio project, after all). I recommend using RPubs as it’s very easy to publish a standalone website through RStudio, but if you have a public-facing website, that’s great too! Please include a URL in your YAML header so I can find it when grading.\n\nThere are lots of reasons you might not want the world to know that you are enrolled in this class, and this is one of your rights under FERPA. If you’re not comfortable including your name, you don’t have to! Your public document can be authored by “Student” (which has a history of being used in statistics).\nIf you are not comfortable attaching your name to something public-facing and this solution doesn’t work for you, please contact me on slack at least 72 hours before the due date so we can make an alternative plan.\n\nThe improved graph has made changes to at least four of the layers of the grammar of graphics (data, aesthetics, geometries, facets, statistics, coordinates, and theme)\n\nAll changes to aesthetics, geometries, etc. should be faithful representations of the underlying data (e.g. changes for the sake of making a change don’t count!)\n\n\nFor this portfolio project, you may work individually or in pairs. If you choose to work in a pair, let me know as soon as you decide so I can make a group repo for you. Both partners should have a record of committing and pushing to the repo.\n\n\nFAQ\nIf you have any questions, please post them to the #portfolio-projects channel on slack.",

    "text": "Why R?\n\nAnd the second reason, which is both a huge strength of R and a bit of a weakness, is that R is not just a programming language. It was designed from day 1 to be an environment that can do data analysis. So, compared to the other options like Python, you can get up and running in R doing data science, learning much, much less about programming to get started. And that generally makes it like easier to get up and running if you don’t have formal training in computer science or software engineering.\n\n\n-Hadley Wickham, Advice to Young (and Old) Programmers: A Conversation with Hadley Wickham"

Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham, Advice to Young (and Old) Programmers: A Conversation with Hadley Wickham; Artwork by Allison Horst"

Make sure the report knits and you get the right values.\n\nNext, add a parameter to your YAML header that stores the location of the data set. Make sure the report knits.\nChange the code chunk where you load the data set to use the data parameter you just defined rather than the hard-coded URL. Make sure the report knits.\nNow, let’s make a parameter for the source of the data set so you don’t have to search where every mention of it in the report, it will be with the other metadata (where it belongs). To do this, add a parameter that gives the source of your data (call it data_source) and set it equal to “the 2022-09-09 repository on Tidy Tuesday.” Make sure the report knits.\nAt this point it looks like everything is working—awesome job! To put it to the test, let’s update the parameters of your report and knit it to see if everything changes as we would expect. Here are the new parameter values:\n\ndata: \"http://math.carleton.edu/aluby/stat220/lego_subset.csv\"\ndata_source: \"Amanda's website\"\n\n(optional) If you have time, or would like to try outside of class, I’ve created a practice gradescope assignment space. First, add .pdf output to your document and knit to PDF. Commit the PDF and push to github. Then, log into gradescope (you may have to go through the link on moodle the first time) and link your github repo. You should then be able to submit your .pdf\n\noutput: \n  html_document:\n    default\n  pdf_document:\n    default"

Trying to think of informative/meaningful names for objects is hard, but necessary work! Below are the fundamental rules for naming objects in R:\n\nnames can’t start with a number\nnames are case-sensitive\nsome common letters are used internally by R and should be avoided as variable names (c, q, t, C, D, F, T, I)\nThere are reserved words that R won’t let you use for variable names (for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next)\nR will let you use the name of a predefined function—but don’t do it!\n\nYou can always check to see if you the name you want to use is already taken via exists():\nFor example lm exists\n\nexists(\"lm\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nbut carleton_college doesn’t.\n\nexists(\"carleton_college\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThere are also a lot of naming styles out there, and if you have coded in another language, you may have already developed a preference.

    "text": "Extracting pieces of data frames\nSince data frames are the fundamental data structure for most analyses in R, it’s important to know how to work with them. You already know how to get an overview of a data frame, but that isn’t always very informative. Often, you want to extract pieces of a data frame, such as a specific column or row.\nExtracting rows\nData frames can be indexed by their row/column numbers. To extract elements of a data frame, the basic syntax is data_set[row.index, column.index]. So, to extract the 10th row of office_ratings we run\n\noffice_ratings[10, ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  season episode title    imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      2       4 The Fire         8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n\n\nNotice that to extract an entire row, we leave the column index position blank.\nWe can also extract multiple rows by creating a vector of row indices. For example, we can extract the first 5 rows via\n\noffice_ratings[1:5, ]\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  season episode title         imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                 7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      1       2 Diversity Day         8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n3      1       3 Health Care           7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n4      1       4 The Alliance          8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n5      1       5 Basketball            8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n\n\nHere, 1:5 create a sequence of integers from 1 to 5.\nWe could also specify arbitrary row index values by combing the values into a vector. For example, we could extract the 1st, 13th, 64th, and 128th rows via\n\noffice_ratings[c(1, 13, 64, 128), ]\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 6\n  season episode title            imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n1      1       1 Pilot                    7.6        3706 2005-03-24\n2      2       7 The Client               8.6        2631 2005-11-08\n3      4      13 Job Fair                 7.9        1977 2008-05-08\n4      7      11 Classy Christmas         8.9        2138 2010-12-09\n\n\nExtracting columns\nSimilar to extracting rows, we can use a numeric index to extract the columns of a data frame. For example, to extract the 3rd column, we can run\n\noffice_ratings[,3]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nAlternatively, we can pass in the column name in quotes instead of the column number\n\noffice_ratings[,\"title\"]\n\n# A tibble: 188 × 1\n   title            \n   &lt;chr&gt;            \n 1 Pilot            \n 2 Diversity Day    \n 3 Health Care      \n 4 The Alliance     \n 5 Basketball       \n 6 Hot Girl         \n 7 The Dundies      \n 8 Sexual Harassment\n 9 Office Olympics  \n10 The Fire         \n# ℹ 178 more rows\n\n\nNotice that the extracted column is still formatted as a data frame (or tibble). If you want to extract the contents of the column and just have a vector of titles, you have a few options.\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column number:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[3]]\n\n\nYou could use double brackets with the column name in quotes:\n\n\noffice_ratings[[\"title\"]]\n\n\nYou could use the $ extractor with the column name (not in quotes):\n\n\noffice_ratings$title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract the 35th row of office_ratings.\nExtract rows 35, 36, 37, and 38 of office_ratings.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column index number.\nExtract the imdb_rating column from office ratings using the column name."

    "section": "Vectors",
    "text": "Vectors\nThe columns of the office_ratings data frame and the elements of the mast list were comprised of (atomic) vectors. Unlike lists, all elements within a vector share the same type. For example, all names in the stat_faculty vector were character strings and all ratings in the imdb_rating column were numeric. We’ll deal with a variety of types of vectors in this course, including:\n\nnumeric\ncharacter (text)\nlogical (TRUE/FALSE)\n\nExtracting elements of a vector\nJust like with lists (and therefore data frames), we use brackets to extract elements from a vector. As an example, let’s work with the title column from office_ratings.\n\ntitle &lt;- office_ratings$title # vector of titles\n\nTo extract the 111th title, we run\n\ntitle[111]\n\n[1] \"New Leads\"\n\n\nor two extract the 100th through 111th titles, we run\n\ntitle[100:111]\n\n [1] \"Double Date\"          \"Murder\"               \"Shareholder Meeting\" \n [4] \"Scott's Tots\"         \"Secret Santa\"         \"The Banker\"          \n [7] \"Sabre\"                \"Manager and Salesman\" \"The Delivery: Part 1\"\n[10] \"The Delivery: Part 2\" \"St. Patrick's Day\"    \"New Leads\"           \n\n\nNegative indices\nSometimes, we want to “kick out” elements of our vector. To do this, we can use a negative index value. For example,\n\ntitle[-1]\n\nreturns all but the first title—that is, it kicks out the first title. To kick out multiple elements, we need to negate a vector of indices. For example, below we kick out the first 10 titles\n\ntitle[-c(1:10)]\n\nAnd now we kick out the 5th, 50th, and 150th titles\n\ntitle[-c(5, 50, 150)]\n\nThis idea can be adapted to lists and data frames. For example, to kick out the first row of office_ratings, we run\n\noffice_ratings[-1,]\n\n# A tibble: 187 × 6\n   season episode title             imdb_rating total_votes air_date  \n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;    \n 1      1       2 Diversity Day             8.3        3566 2005-03-29\n 2      1       3 Health Care               7.9        2983 2005-04-05\n 3      1       4 The Alliance              8.1        2886 2005-04-12\n 4      1       5 Basketball                8.4        3179 2005-04-19\n 5      1       6 Hot Girl                  7.8        2852 2005-04-26\n 6      2       1 The Dundies               8.7        3213 2005-09-20\n 7      2       2 Sexual Harassment         8.2        2736 2005-09-27\n 8      2       3 Office Olympics           8.4        2742 2005-10-04\n 9      2       4 The Fire                  8.4        2713 2005-10-11\n10      2       5 Halloween                 8.2        2561 2005-10-18\n# ℹ 177 more rows\n\n\nor to kick out the math courses from the mast list we run\n\nmast[-4]\n\n$stat_faculty\n[1] \"Kelling\"   \"Loy\"       \"Luby\"      \"Poppick\"   \"St. Clair\" \"Wadsworth\"\n\n$stat_courses\n[1] 120 220 230 250 285 330\n\n$math_faculty\n [1] \"Brooke\"              \"Davis\"               \"Egge\"               \n [4] \"Gomez-Gonzales\"      \"Haunsperger\"         \"Johnson\"            \n [7] \"Meyer\"               \"Montee\"              \"Shrestha\"           \n[10] \"Terry\"               \"Thompson\"            \"Turnage-Butterbaugh\"\n\n\nLogical indices\nIt’s great to be able to extract (or omit) elements using indices, but sometimes we don’t know what index value we should use. For example, if you wanted to extract all of the 300-level statistics courses from the stat_courses vector, you would need to manually determine that positions 2:5 meet that requirement. That’s a lot of work! A better alternative is to allow R to find the elements meeting that requirement using logical operators. Below is a table summarizing common logical operators in R.\n\n\nComparison\nMeaning\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nis equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n\nIn order to extract the 300-level statistics courses, we’ll take two steps:\n\nWe’ll determine whether each course is numbered at least 300,\nthen we’ll use that sequence of TRUEs/FALSEs to extract the course.\n\nSo, first we use the logical operator &gt;= to compare stat_courses and 300. This returns TRUE if the element meets the specification and FALSE otherwise.\n\nstat_courses &gt;= 300\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nNow, we can use this vector as our index. Only the TRUE elements will be extracted:\n\nstat_courses[stat_courses &gt;= 300]\n\n[1] 330\n\n\nThe same idea can be used with data frames and lists, just remember how to format the brackets and indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Check point\n\n\n\n\nExtract all statistics courses below 250 from stat_courses.\nExtract all math courses except for 240 (probability) from math_courses.\nExtract all rows from season 3 of The Office."
